# AMAZON-SALES-ANALYSIS

This repository contains the analysis and insights from an Amazon Sales dataset, focusing on customer ratings, discounts, and product categories. The aim was to provide a clear overview of key metrics and trends to guide data-driven decisions for product management, marketing, and customer engagement.

## Project Overview
The Amazon Sales Analysis project seeks to identify and visualize patterns in customer ratings, discount distribution, and product categories to help stakeholders make informed strategic decisions. Using Excel for data preparation and Power BI for visualization, we built an interactive dashboard that highlights sales metrics and customer engagement levels across various categories.

## Key Metrics
The dashboard presents insights on the following metrics:
Product Rating Count by Category: Visualizes customer engagement by showing the number of ratings per product category.
Discount Percentage by Category: Displays average discount percentages across categories, helping to identify discount strategies.
Average Rating by Discount Percentage: Analyzes customer feedback in relation to discount levels, which provides insights into customer satisfaction.
Total Rating Count: Sum of all customer ratings, providing an overall engagement metric for the analyzed products.

## Tools Used
Excel: Used for data cleaning, sorting, and preliminary analysis.
Power BI: Utilized for creating interactive visualizations to make the data accessible and actionable.

## Files Included
Amazon_Sales_Dashboard.pbix: Power BI file for the interactive dashboard.
Amazon_Sales_Data.xlsx: Excel file with the raw and cleaned data used for analysis.
Report_Summary.pdf: A detailed summary report outlining the analysis process, key findings, and recommendations.

## Insights and Recommendations
Top Categories: Categories like Home & Kitchen, Electronics, and Computers & Accessories have the highest rating counts, indicating strong customer interest.
Discount Analysis: Categories such as Home Improvement and Health & Personal Care have higher average discount rates, which may influence customer purchasing behavior.
Customer Engagement: There is a notable relationship between discount levels and customer ratings, suggesting that discounts might enhance customer satisfaction in certain categories.
